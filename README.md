This repository is only meant for showcase. It will not be updated any further
and will be archived.

This also is not the best example on writing an application using Vue. It is
functional, however dirty on the inside, and I was planning to clean some of
it up (e.g. `dangerbutton` could have been renamed to `dialogbutton` and
`forminputtext` could have had support for `v-model`).
